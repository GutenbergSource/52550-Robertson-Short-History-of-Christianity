<HTML><BODY>After processing his <i>Short History of Freethought</i>, we now turn to Robertson's <i>Short History of Christianity</i>, written from an atheist point of view (but of course also relying on Christian-made records, something that is unavoidable given the subject).

<p>The book is straighforward text, so should not pose to much of a challenge to the proofreader or formatter

<p>Have Fun!
